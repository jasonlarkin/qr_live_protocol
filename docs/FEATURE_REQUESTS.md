## Feature Request Examples

### ✅ Good Feature Request

```markdown
## Feature Request: OBS Studio Plugin

### Problem/Use Case
Currently, users need to add a Browser Source in OBS to display QR codes.
This requires manual configuration and isn't as smooth as a native plugin.

### Proposed Solution
Create a native OBS Studio plugin that:
- Automatically connects to QRLP server
- Provides easy configuration interface
- Supports multiple QR display styles
- Includes real-time preview

### Implementation Ideas
- Use OBS Studio plugin SDK
- Written in C++ for performance
- Plugin settings stored in OBS config
- WebSocket connection to QRLP server

### Priority: High - Critical for streaming workflows
### Category: Integration
```

### ❌ Poor Feature Request

```markdown
## Feature Request: Make it better
